## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

When started the simulation it will:

## Ask the user about the size of the room.
This is inputted with two integers separated with a space.
## Ask the user about starting position and heading of the RC car.
This is inputted with two integers and one letter separated with spaces. The letter can be N, S, W or E.
## Ask the user about the commands to execute.
This is inputted with all commands in series. Available commands are F, B, L or R.

And then it should run the simulation to see if the car can run without hitting any walls.
Sample input: 86
23N FFFRFFLBB


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
