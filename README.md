## Getting Started

Welcome to the Car simulator made with Java

`When running the application main in App.java the execution order will be:`

## The application will ask the user about the size of the room.
This is inputted with two integers separated with a space.
## Then ask the user about starting position and heading of the RC car.
This is inputted with two integers and one letter separated with spaces. The letter can be N, S, W or E.
## Then ask the user about the commands to execute.
This is inputted with all commands in series. Available commands are F, B, L or R.

And then it should run the simulation to see if the car can run without hitting any walls.
Sample input: 86
