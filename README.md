## Getting Started

Welcome to the Car simulator made with Java

When running the application main in `App.java` the execution order will be:

## The application will ask the user about the size of the room.
This is inputted with two integers separated with a space.
## Then ask the user about starting position and heading of the RC car.
This is inputted with two integers and one letter separated with spaces. The letter can be N, S, W or E.
## Then ask the user about the commands to execute.
This is inputted with all commands in series. Available commands are F, B, L or R.

And then it should run the simulation to see if the car can run without hitting any walls.
Sample input: 86

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
