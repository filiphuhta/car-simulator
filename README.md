## Getting Started

Welcome to the Car simulator made with Java

## The application will ask the user about the size of the room.
This is inputted with two integers separated with a space.
## Ask the user about starting position and heading of the RC car.
This is inputted with two integers and one letter separated with spaces. The letter can be N, S, W or E.
## Ask the user about the commands to execute.
This is inputted with all commands in series. Available commands are F, B, L or R.

And then it should run the simulation to see if the car can run without hitting any walls.
Sample input: 86
